# {{ NAME }} Route Design Recipe

_Copy this design recipe template to test-drive a plain-text Flask route._

## 1. Design the Route Signature

_Include the HTTP method, the path, and any query or body parameters._

```

# Sort names route

POST / sort-names
    names: string (comma separated list)
    
# Request:
POST http://localhost:5000/sort-names

# With body parameters:
names=Joe,Alice,Zoe,Julia,Kieran

# Expected response (sorted list of names):
Alice,Joe,Julia,Kieran,Zoe

```

## 2. Create Examples as Tests

_Go through each route and write down one or more example responses._

_Remember to try out different parameter values._

_Include the status code and the response body._

```python
# EXAMPLE


# POST /sort-names
#  Parameters: names = Joe,Alice,Zoe,Julia,Kieran
#  Expected response (200 ok ): 'Joe,Alice,Zoe,Julia,Kieran'
"""
Please provide a name and a message
"""
```

## 3. Test-drive the Route

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._

Here's an example for you to start with:

```python
"""
GET /home
  Expected response (200 OK):
  "This is my home page!"
"""
def test_get_home(web_client):
    response = web_client.get('/home')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.data.decode('utf-8') == 'This is my home page!'

"""
POST /submit
  Parameters:
    name: Leo
    message: Hello world
  Expected response (200 OK):
  "Thanks Leo, you sent this message: "Hello world""
"""
def test_post_submit(web_client):
    response = web_client.post('/submit', data={'name': 'Leo', 'message': 'Hello world'})
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.data.decode('utf-8') == 'Thanks Leo, you sent this message: "Hello world"'
```
